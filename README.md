# Pythoncodes

1. TSP.py is my python based solution to the Sales Man's travele problem (STP) (A well known NP-complete problem). I have used Botzmann's Machine for solving this optimization problem. Details about the problem description is in the file OnlineNeuralNetsPS10.pdf file. The code is well documented and comments are added to make it readable. 
TSPreport.pdf is the a write up about the solution

2. Multilayer_NN.py is my solution to classification problem that advertising companies face in identifying targeted customers. The problem description can be found in ClassificationProgrammingAssignment_A.pdf. The code is well documented and comments are added to make it easy to read. 
classification report.pdf is a write up explaining the implementation. 

3. solution.py is my python code implementing Naive Bayes and perceptron learning models. The problem description to this and the training data can be found in the zipped TrainingDataandtracefiles.zip. The file also contains the trace file from running the program
